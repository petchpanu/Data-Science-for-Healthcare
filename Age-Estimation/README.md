# Age Estimation using Convolutional Neural Network

To estimate the age using CNN

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6.8
- OpenCV 4.1.0
- joblib 0.13.2
- Keras 2.2.4
- h5py 2.9.0

## Getting Start

To Download Adience Dataset:

## Methodology

The image data will be import into the memory and normalized. Augmentation will be used to io enhance the model performance.

## Pretrain Model
> - VGGFace: http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/2015/Parkhi15/parkhi15.pdf
> - Inception-ResNet: https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07261

## Model Evaluation

Evaluation metrics, such as **Accuracy, F1 Score, Balanced Accuracy Score, ROC and PR curve**, are used to determine the model that give the best prediction.

## Analysis on Error

The misclassified comments will be visualized.

## Conclusion and Future Improvement
