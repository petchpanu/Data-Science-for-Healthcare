## Methodology



## Model Evaluation

Evaluation metrics, such as **Accuracy, ROC and PR curve**, are used to determine the model that give the best prediction. Also, the noun phrase will be extracted from the predicted comments and visualize using **Wordcloud** to find which words are common.

## Analysis on Error

The misclassified comments will be analyzed to find pattern that might cause the prediction error.
